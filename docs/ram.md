# Random Access Memory (RAM)

## Purpose

RAM allows your computer to perform most of its everyday tasks, such as loading applications, browsing the internet, or playing games. Memory also allows you to switch quickly among these tasks while also remembering where you are in each task. Generally speaking, the more memory you have, the better for multitasking.
