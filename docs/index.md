# Our Log of The Sea of Cortez (June 2023)

In June 2023, our two families, Neumann and Popov, endeavor an adventure together at sea. We spend 7 days sailing the Sea of Cortez onboard _Grieg_, a 46-foot Dufor sloop. We sail a loop from the southern point of La Paz to the northern point of San Evaristo and back. We enjoy Father's Day and Summer Solstice at sea and visit coastal towns of Baja California Sur and the jewels of Isla Partida, Isla San Francisco, Isla San Jose, and Isla Espiritu Santo. Our intrepid crew:

- Michael (50)
- Amy (47)
- Zarko (43)
- Magdalena (40)
- Tobias (12)
- Asher (10)
- Aleksandar (10)
- Maksim (5)
